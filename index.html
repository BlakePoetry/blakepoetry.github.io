			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>Piping down the valleys wild,<br />
				Piping songs of pleasant glee,<br />
				On a cloud I saw a child,<br />
				And he laughing said to me:</p>

			<p>"Pipe a song about a Lamb!"<br />
				So I piped with merry chear.<br />
				"Piper, pipe that song again"<br />
				So I piped, he wept to hear.</p>

			<p>"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;<br />
				Sing thy songs of happy chear-<br />
				So I sung the same again,<br />
				While he wept with joy to hear.</p>

			<p>"Piper, sit thee down and write<br />
				In a book, that all may read."<br />
				So he vanish'd from my sight,<br />
				And I pluck'd a hollow reed,</p>

			<p>And I made a rural pen,<br />
				And I stain'd the water clear,<br />
				And I wrote my happy songs<br />
				Every child may joy to hear.</p>

			<h3>The Shepherd</h3>

			<p>How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!<br />
				From the morn to the evening he strays;<br />
				He shall follows his sheep all the day,<br />
				And his tongue shall be filled with praise.</p>

			<p>For he hears the lamb's innocent call,<br />
				And he hears the ewe's tender reply;<br />
				He is watchful while they are in peace,<br />
				For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.</p>

			<p>The Sun does arise,<br />

				To welcome the Spring;<br />
				The sky-lark and thrush,<br />
				The birds of the bush.<br />
				Sing louder around<br />
				To the bells' chearful sound,<br />
				While our sports shall be seen<br />

			<p>Little Lamb, who made thee?<br />

			<p>Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,<br />
				Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:<br />
				He is called by thy name,<br />

				He is meek &amp; he is mild;<br />
				He became a little child.<br />
				I a child &amp; thou a lamb.<br />

			<h3>The Little Black Boy</h3>

			<p>My mother bore me in the southern wild,<br />
				And I am black. but O! my soul is white;<br />
				White as an angel is the English child,<br />
				But I am black as if bereav'd of light.</p>

			<p>My mother taught me underneath a tree,<br />
				And, sitting down before the heat of day,<br />
				She took me on her lap and kissed me,<br />
				And pointing to the east began to say:</p>

			<p>"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,<br />
				And gives his light, and gives his heat away;<br />
				And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieve<br />
				Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.</p>

			<p>"And we are put on earth a little space,<br />
				That we may learn to bear the beams of love;<br />
				And these black bodies and this sunburnt face<br />
				Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.</p>

				The cloud will vanish: we shall hear his voice,<br />
				Saying: 'Come out from the grove, my love &amp; care.<br />
				And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.'</p>

			<p>Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;<br />
				And thus I say to little English boy.<br />
				When I from black and he from white cloud free.<br />
				And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,</p>

			<p>I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear<br />
				To lean in joy upon our father's knee;<br />
				And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,<br />
				And be like him, and he will then love me.</p>

			<h3>The Chimney Sweeper</h3>

			<p>When my mother died I was very young,<br />
				And my father sold me while yet my tongue<br />
				Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"<br />
				So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.</p>

			<p>There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,<br />
				That curl'd llke a lamb's back. was shav'd: so I said<br />
				"Hush. Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare<br />
				You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."</p>

			<p>And so he was quiet &amp; that very night,<br />
				As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!<br />
				That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned or Jack.<br />
				Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black.</p>

			<p>And by came an Angel who had a bright key,<br />
				And he open'd the coffins &amp; set them all free;<br />
				Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,<br />
				And wash in a river. and shine in the Sun.</p>

			<p>Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,<br />
				They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;<br />
				And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,<br />
				He'd have God for his father &amp; never want joy.</p>

			<p>And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark.<br />
				And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.<br />
				Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm;<br />
				So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.</p>

			<p>"Father! father! where are you going!<br />
				O do not walk so fast.<br />
				Speak, father, speak to your little boy,<br />
				Or else I shall be lost."</p>

			<p>The night was dark, no father was there;<br />
				The child was wet with dew;<br />
				The mire was deep, &amp; the child did weep,<br />
				And away the vapour flew.</p>

			<p>When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,<br />

				Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames' waters flow.</p>

			<p>O what a multitude they seem'd, these flowers of London town!<br />
				Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own.<br />
				The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,<br />
				Thousands of little boys &amp; girls raising their innocent hands.</p>

			<p>Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,<br />
				Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among.<br />
				Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;<br />
				Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.</p>

				And joy without ceasing,<br />

				Never, never can it be!</p>

			<p>And can he who smiles on all<br />
				Hear the wren with sorrows small,<br />
				Hear the small bird's grief &amp; care,<br />
				Hear the woes that infants bear,</p>

			<p>And not sit beside the nest,<br />
				Pouring pity in their breast;<br />
				And not sit the cradle near,<br />
				Weeping tear on infant's tear;</p>

			<p>And not sit both night &amp; day,<br />
				Wiping all our tears away?<br />
				O! no, never can it be!<br />
				Never, never can it be!</p>

			<p>He doth give his joy to all;<br />
				He becomes an infant small;<br />
				He becomes a man of woe;<br />
				He doth feel the sorrow too.</p>

			<p>Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,<br />
				And thy maker is not by;<br />
				Think not thou canst weep a tear,<br />
				And thy maker is not near.</p>

			<p>O! he gives to us his joy<br />
				That our grief he may destroy;<br />
				Till our grief is fled &amp; gone<br />
				He doth sit by us and moan.</p>
