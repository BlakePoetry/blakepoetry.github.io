		<h3>The School Boy</h3>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>I love to rise in a summer morn,</p>

			<p>When the birds sing on every tree;</p>

			<p>The distant huntsman winds his horn,</p>

			<p>And the sky-lark sings with me.</p>

			<p>O! what sweet company.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>But to go to school in a summer morn.</p>

			<p>In sighing and dismay.</p>

			<p>Ah! then at times I drooping sit,</p>

			<p>And spend many an anxious hour.</p>

			<p>Worn thro' with the dreary shower.</p>

			<p>How can the bird that is born for joy,</p>

			<p>And forget his youthful spring</p>

			<p>O! father &amp; mother, if buds are nip'd,</p>

			<p>By sorrow and cares dismay,</p>

		<h3>The Voice of the Ancient Bard</h3>

		<div class="stanza">
			<p>Youth of delight come hither:</p>

			<p>And see the opening morn,</p>

			<p>Image of truth new born.</p>

			<p>Doubt is fled &amp; clouds of reason</p>

			<p>Dark disputes &amp; artful teazing.</p>

			<p>Folly is an endless maze,</p>

			<p>Tangled roots perplex her ways,</p>

			<p>How many have fallen there!</p>

			<p>They stumble all night over bones of the dead;</p>

			<p>And feel they know not what but care;</p>

			<p>And wish to lead others when they should be led.</p>
